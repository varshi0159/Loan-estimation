# Loan-estimation

The primary objective of a loan default estimation project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on their loan. By identifying high-risk borrowers, financial institutions can make informed decisions regarding loan approvals, risk mitigation strategies, and portfolio management.
